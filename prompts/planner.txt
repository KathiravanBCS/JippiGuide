Build a 'Planner' page for a travel guide app. Allow users to select a travel mode (driving, cycling, foot), enter start and end locations, and display a map with the route. Include options to filter points of interest (restaurants, cafes, hotels, parks, attractions, fuel, transport) along the route. The UI should be interactive and responsive, with a modern look. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
