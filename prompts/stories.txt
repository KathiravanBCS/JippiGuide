Create a 'Travel Stories' page for a travel guide app. Display a grid of story cards, each with an image and a title. The layout should be responsive, showing 2-3 columns on larger screens. Each card should have a modern look with rounded corners and a subtle shadow. Add a main heading at the top. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
