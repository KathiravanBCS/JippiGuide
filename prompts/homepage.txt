Design a modern, visually appealing homepage for a travel guide web app. The page should feature three large, clickable cards ("Stories", "Gallery", "Travel Packages"), each with a background image, title, and subtitle. The cards should have a hover effect that slightly zooms the image and adds a shadow. Use a responsive layout that looks good on both mobile and desktop. The overall style should be clean, with rounded corners and subtle gradients. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
